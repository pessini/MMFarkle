FARKLE RULES

You will need: 6 dice, paper and pencil

How to play: Each player must score 500 points in one turn to ‘get on the board’. If a
player ‘farkles’ before reaching 500 their turn is over and they pass the dice to the next player.
Once a player has gotten on the board they can quit at any time during their turn, regardless of
how many points they score during that turn.

Play to 5,000. Once someone scores 5,000 (or more) the remaining players have one last turn.
There are ways you can vary the game at this point. If someone beats the original player who
reached 5,000, they can be declared the winner, or if you want to continue playing, let each
player have one more turn, each time anyone beats the high scorer.

How to score: Players begin by rolling all 6 dice. In order not to ‘farkle’ each roll in a
turn must come up with something that ‘counts’. Scoring dice are set aside and contribute their
score for that turn. If a player decides to continue rolling during their turn they use the remaining
dice. If at any time ‘all’ the dice produce points the player has the option to begin again
with all six dice. This still counts as one turn and should they ‘farkle’ (roll and come up with
nothing that scores) they will lose any points accumulated turning that turn. Once points are
recorded they cannot be lost.

What counts:

All six dice the sam............1,000
3 pair..........................1,000
A straight (1 through 6)........1,000
3 ones..........................1,000
One.............................100
Five............................50

3 of any number equals that number times 100 (except ones they equal 1000) i.e.
3 twos...............200
3 threes.............300
3 fours..............400
3 fives..............500
3 sixes..............600


Have fun, play fair and take a risk now and then!
